# Coup CLI

> This is a CLI implementation of the game of [COUP](http://gamegrumps.wikia.com/wiki/Coup).

</p>

This app is designed as a code challenge.
It challenges you to write a bot that plays [COUP](http://gamegrumps.wikia.com/wiki/Coup) against other bots.

The idea is you have three rounds of (1,000,000) games to find the winner (sum all scores).
Between each round you have time to make adjustments to your bot.

## How does this work?

- [How do I build a bot](#how-do-i-build-a-bot)
- [How does the engine work](#how-does-the-engine-work)
- [Development](#development)

## Rules

1. No changes to engine
1. Name of bots don't change between rounds (so you can target specific bots)
1. No data sharing between games within a round
1. No file access to other bots
1. No changing other bots
1. No internet access
1. Do not output to `stdout`

## Scoring

Each game is a zero-sum-game in terms of score.
The score is determined by the number of players (can't be more than 6 per game) and winners
(there are instances where the game can stall in a stale-mate with multiple winners).
Each game will take a max of 6 bots that are randomly elected.
Those who win get a positive score, those who lose will get a negative score.

- Score for losers: `-1/(players-1)`
- Score for winners: `∑losers/winners`

## How to run the game

<p align="center">
	<img width="968" src="assets/loop.gif">
</p>

The game comes with two simple "dumb" bots that just randomizes it's answers without checking much whether the actions are appropriate.
Each bot lives inside its own folder inside the `bots` folder.
The name of the folder determines the bots name.

```sh
.
├── bots
│   ├── bot1
│   │   └── index.js
│   ├── bot1
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── bot1
│       └── index.js
│
├── src
│   ├── constants.js
│   ├── helper.js
│   └── index.js
│
├── test
│   └── test.js
│
└── README.md
```

To run the game `cd` into the folder.
Install dependencies (`prettier`):

```sh
yarn
```

**Do make sure you run the formatter before each commit**

Run the formatter via:

```sh
yarn format
```

To play the game run:

```sh
yarn play
```

To run 1000 games:

```sh
yarn loop
```

To run `n` number of games:

```sh
yarn loop -- -r [n]
```

In the loop rounds all output is suppressed so that the games run smoothly on the day.
For development please use the `-d` flag to enable debug mode. It will stop the game loop when it
encounters an error and display the last game with error.

```sh
yarn loop -r [number] -d
```

To run the test suit:

```sh
yarn test
```

## How do I build a bot

- Create a folder in the `bots` folder (next to the fake bots)
- Pick a name for your bot (You should have a list of names before hand so bots can target specific other bots)
- Include an `index.js` file that exports below class
- Run as many test rounds as you want to
- Create PR on the day of each round

You get to require 4 functions from the engine at `constants.js` inside your bot:

- `ALLBOTS()` Returns an array of all players in the game `<Player>`
- `CARDS()` Returns an array of all 5 card types `<Card>`
- `DECK()` Returns an array of all cards in the deck (3 of each)
- `ACTIONS()` Returns an array of all actions `<Action>`

> TIP: If you console log out the string `STOP` the loop will stop as soon as a game prints this and print everything out from that game. Great for debugging.
> Just make sure you remove the console log before submitting.

### `<Player>`

- `exampleBot1`
- `exampleBot2`

### `<Card>`

- `duke`
- `assassin`
- `captain`
- `ambassador`
- `contessa`

### `<Action>`

- `taking-1`
- `foreign-aid`
- `couping`
- `taking-3`
- `assassination`
- `stealing`
- `swapping`

### `<CounterAction>`

- `foreign-aid` -> [`duke`, `false`],
- `assassination` -> [`contessa`, `false`],
- `stealing` -> [`captain`, `ambassador`, `false`],
- `taking-3` -> [`duke`, `false`],

### Class to export

The class you have to export from your bot needs to include the below methods:

- `onTurn`
  - Called when it is your turn to decide what you may want to do
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards }`
  - returns: `{ action: <Action>, against: <Player> }`
- `onChallengeActionRound`
  - Called when another bot made an action and everyone gets to decide whether they want to challenge that action
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards, action, byWhom, toWhom }`
  - returns: `<Boolean>`
- `onCounterAction`
  - Called when someone does something that can be countered with a card: `foreign-aid`, `stealing` and `assassination`
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards, action, byWhom }`
  - returns: `<CounterAction>`
- `onCounterActionRound`
  - Called when a bot did a counter action and everyone gets to decided whether they want to challenge that counter action
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards, action, byWhom, toWhom, card, counterer }`
  - returns: `<Boolean>`
- `onSwappingCards`
  - Called when you played your ambassador and now need to decide which cards you want to keep
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards, newCards }`
  - returns: `Array(<Card>)`
- `onCardLoss`
  - Called when you lose a card to decide which one you want to lose
  - parameters: `{ history, myCards, myCoins, otherPlayers, discardedCards }`
  - returns: `<Card>`

### The parameters

Each function is passed one parameter object that can be deconstructed into the below items.

| parameter        | description                                                                                                                                                    |

### The history array

Each event is recorded in the history array. See below a list of all events and it's entires:

An action:

```
{
	type: 'action',
	action: <Action>,
	from: <Player>,
	to: <Player>,
}
```

Lose a card:

```
{
	type: 'lost-card',
	player: <Player>,
	lost: <Card>,
}
```

Challenge outcome:

```
{
	type: 'challenge-round' || 'counter-round',
	challenger: <Player>,
	challengee: <Player>,
	player: <Player>,
	action: <Action>,
	lying: <Boolean>,
}
```

A Penalty:

```
{
	type: 'penalty',
	from: <Player>,
}
```

An unsuccessful challenge:

```
{
	type: 'unsuccessful-challenge',
	action: 'swap-1',
	from: <Player>,
}
```

A counter action:

```
{
	type: 'counter-action',
	action: <Action>,
	from: <Player>,
	to: <Player>,
	counter: <Card>,
	counterer: <Player>,
}
```

## How does the engine work

The challenge algorithm:

```
if( assassination, stealing, swapping )
	ChallengeRound via all bot.OnChallengeActionRound
		? false = continue
		: true = stop

if( foreign-aid, assassination, stealing )
	CounterAction via bot.OnCounterAction
		? false = continue
		: true = CounterChallengeRound via bot.OnCounterActionRound
			? false = continue
			: true = stop

else
	do-the-thing
```

## Development

The game comes with it's own [test runner](./test/test.js) that runs through all(?) possible moves a bot can make.
You can execute the test runner via `yarn test:code`.
